You told me that you rocked in bed
That you were great at games and had tons of friends
But we both know that this isn't true
And now I'm ashamed I ever dated you

Douchebag, your collar's popped so high
I'd love to kill you, but it looks like you already died 
(he could be like “no I didn't” and then immediately gets killed by her)

I hate to pop into your lobby uninvited
But I just had to say, I'm feeling slighted
You play my favorite game, and now I am reminded
That I can do so much better
(he could be like “seriously, are you finished?”)

Never will, I date someone like you
I wish nothing but the worst for you too
I won't forgive you, or beg
And I told all of my friends
Sometimes it lasts in love, but you never did in bed
Sometimes it lasts in love, but you never did in bed
