# Rookshot - Chapter One

Map: High Ground

## Scene One

The first scene should introduce Dakota, Addison, and then Mark. It should show Dakota's controlling nature, and his insistence on good role playing, Addison's relative aloofness, the fact that he only plays because he has nothing else to do, and Mark's reluctance to play Halo 3 at all because it is an "old" game, and reluctance to role play "again".

Dakota is in the sniper nest, scoping out the map. Addison pops in/joins the game.

[Addison] Hey.

[Dakota] Hey Addison.

[Addison] What are you looking at?

[Dakota] Just watching for the enemy. They should be here soon, and I don't want us to be caught off guard.

[Addison] You know it will make a notification when they join, right?

[Dakota] {stands and turns to Addison} Damn it Addison. Does the fourth wall mean anything to you?

[Addison] Right. You do the roleplaying thing. Forgot. Sorry.

[Dakota] Where's Mark?

[Addison] Should be here any minute. His last text said he'd be on when he finished breakfast.

[Dakota] {pause}

[Addison] I mean. He sent a telegram.

[Dakota] {a you serious?} A telegram.

[Addison] Hey man at least I'm trying.

Mark pops in/joins the game.

[Mark] Yo.

[Dakota] Alright we're all here. Did you guys read the character bios I sent you?

[Mark] Oh not this shit again, Dakota. I still get dick pics from the last time.

[Addison] Yeh Dakota my new phone charges me like twenty sents per picture message so I'm ~~not sure if I want~~ {strikethrough is interrupted}

[Dakota] There won't be any dick pics this time! Promise.

[Mark] Yeh well I'm still using fake phone number on the sign up.

[Dakota] There's no sign up; it's not a competition; I just want to to roleplay in matchmaking and customs.

[Addison] What? Like the other people won't be roleplaying?

[Dakota] No.

[Mark] Ok so not only will we look retarded, but we'll be the *only* ones who look retarded. Why the fuck are we playing Halo 3 anyway? This game's like a century old.

[Dakota] It's only a few years old you prick. And besides, all the casual players have moved on to Reach and 4. The only ones left are fans who know the lore and stuff.

[Addison] This is dumb.

[Mark] I'm going to play Battlefield.

[Dakota] Wait! Addison, you have no friends. What else would you be doing?

[Addison] {silence}

[Dakota] Mark, Melissa plays Halo 3.

[Mark] And why would my ex being here make me *want* to play?

[Dakota] She has a better K/D than you.

[Addison] Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

[Mark] Shut the fuck up Addison.

[Dakota] Well?

[Mark] Fine. I'll play with you guys. But only to honor my commitment to being better than her at everything. Once I've got a higher K/D I'm out. What's hers?

Dakota and Addison exchange a look.

[Dakota] 7.

[Mark] WHAT?

[Dakota] And we're playing her in a few seconds.

[Mark] WHAT?

A buzzer goes off.

[Dakota] It's time! Stations! Get in character! {heads down the stairs}

[Addison] {turns to Mark} Good luck faggot. {heads down the stairs}

Mark stands still.

## Scene Two

The second scene should introduce Melissa. It should show her as domineering.

Melissa will have a her sniper and be scoping out the sniper's nest, showing Dakota's back there. Next to her is her team mate.

Melissa lowers her rifle and turns to her teammate.

[Melissa] They're just playing with their dicks up there.

[Teammate] Why are they standing facing each other?

[Melissa] If I had to guess I'd say Dakota's making them roleplay. He'll pretend not to hear you if you aren't in physical earshot.

[Teammate] Wow.

[Melissa] Alright listen. You'll stick to the right and go through the hole in wall up into the base. You tell me where everyone is, and I'll come through and kill them.

[Teammate] If I see them, shouldn't I just kill them myself?

[Melissa] No. You won't kill anyone; you're only a scout. Leave the killing to me.

[Teammate] What? No that's retarded. If they start shooting at me what am I supposed to do, run?

[Melissa] Yes, but don't forget to tell me where.

[Teammate] Wow ok this is stupid. I'm going to forge with my friends.

Teammate quits/leaves the game.

[Melissa] {what a prick} Whatever.

Melissa starts making progess up the shore.

## Scene Three

Scene three will demonstrate the three main character's relative incompentence, and show Mark's habit of overestimating himself.

Mark is in the sniper's nest, and sees Melissa on his scope. Melissa in his scope stops and looks through her scope at him. She then lowers it and begins jumping to catch his attention.

[Mark] She's fucking mocking me! Take lead bitch!

Mark proceeds to fire four rounds in succession, all missing in different directions.

---

Melissa laughs and continutes walking up the hill.

---

Mark reloads.

[Mark] It's my damn sensitivity. It's so high I can hardly tap the stick without making a 180.

Dakota walks off the turret to yell from the bottom of the stairs.

[Dakota] What was that Mark?

[Mark] God damn it. I mean, uh, I need to take sedatives.

[Dakota] {turns and walks away} Dumbass.

Dakota sees Melissa from the bridge turret.

[Dakota] I got her! She's coming up center!

Dakota fires the turret, and Melissa dodges. She spike-grenades the turret.

[Dakota] Oh da~~mn it.~~ {explodes}

Melissa proceeds up the hole in the wall.

---

Mark is scoping again from the sniper's nest.

[Mark] Where is that bitch?

Melissa is crouching, and creeping up behind Mark.

[Melissa] Found her.

Melissa melees Mark from behind.

---

Mark respawns in the lobby.

[Mark] Damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it. {fires randomly in all directions, jumping around}

Dakota watches this happen.

---

Addison is at the bottom of the stairs to the sniper nest. He can see Melissa tbagging Mark, yelling about it.

[Addison] Sorry Melissa. {throws spike grenade}

[Melissa] Huh? {is spiked; explodes}

---

Addison spawns in the lobby.

[Addison] Wait, what happened? I just got a kill.

[Dakota] Yeh. It was a game of last man standing. Apparently her teammate left, so we won when she died.

Mark is still shooting everywhere.

[Addison] {looks at Mark} Is he pissed?

[Dakota] {looks at Mark} Hasn't stopped since he spawned. He'll run out of ammo any second now I figure.

Mark stops shooting and starts running toward Dakota and Addison.

[Dakota] {looks at Addison} Called it.

[Mark] I've got a idea.

[Addison] Oh no.

[Dakota] Spill it.

[Mark] I can't kill her in competitive play, but I know where I can beat her.

[Addison] Dude she has a 7 K/D and she's a famous forge artist. What else is there in Halo 3?

[Mark] Slander. {Mark pops out/leaves game}

[Addison] What is talking about?

[Dakota] I don't know, but he'll need supervision.

Dakota pops out, and Addison follows.
