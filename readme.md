# Rookshot

Rookshot is a series story following three people who play Halo 3 on Xbox 360 mostly a ghost town with the exception of some experienced clans and young children inheriting games from their older siblings. It features their adventures through the post apocalyptic land that is any console game older than two years.

## Characters

There are three primary characters. Everyone else is only relevant through their relationship with the trio.

### Dakota

Dakota is the reason the trio is playing Halo 3. He enjoys games for the roleplaying aspect, and thought to play Halo 3 thinking that most of the casual players would have moved on, leaving the passionate ones who know all the lore.

He is easily frustrated by people breaking the fourth wall; something for which Mark will be a catalyst. He dedicates time and effort to backstories and plot twists as an explanation for everything in the game, and presses the other two to read his fanfaction before they play matchmaking games so that they can play their characters well.

His attitude is confident; these ideas are presented as if he entertains the impression that Mark and Addison are the ones not meeting expectations. This dissonance frustrates him.

Trivia

 * He never misses with the sniper.
 * Every time a rated match is close, his mom calls him to do something.
 * Had a roleplaying clan in WoW, which he often references.

### Mark

Mark plays video games primarily for the comptetive aspect. He is very concerned with game statistics like his K/D spread. His focusing on competition and Dakota focusing on role playing often conflict with one another.

He severely overestimates himself, often explaining his poor performance by citing some small inhibiting factor, faithful that once it is removed he will achieve unparalleled success. For example, "I just had my sensitivity too high, but now that it is one notch lower I'll be headshotting everythone." Mentioning controls of course frustrates Dakota.

His attitude is domineering and at times aggressive.

Trivia

 * Likes to measure his skill against dummies he sets up in local play.
 * Studying to be a game programmer; but struggles with simple programs.
 * Ex girlfriend plays xbox (Melissa); hopes he can snipe her in matchmaking.

### Addison

Addison plays video games because Dakota asks him to (he is his little brother). He is relatively aloof about the goals of either other character, but has little else to do. While the two of them argue about things Addison often ventures off to accomplish the objective on his own. Dakota and Mark both fail to notice this pattern, always attributing their victories to the small contribution they individually made.

His attitude is aloof, but sometimes tired (of Dakota and Mark fighting).

Trivia

 * Believes in sky mermaids.
 * Is secretive about what he does in his free time.
 * It is often implied that he is sleeping with Melissa.

### Melissa

Melissa plays video games to beat Mark. They dated in highschool, and he broke up with her to get head at a party, then tried to get together with her directly afterward. He failed. Her mission now is spite.

She got someone else to add his gamertag to find what he was playing, and then began hunting for him in Halo 3.

She is partial to Addison, and pleasant with most people.

Her attitude is narcissistic, and in the case of Mark, sadistic.

Trivia

 * Renowned forge artist "THE Melissa"; forges many of the clan match stages.
 * Likes to browse deviant art for earth paintings; bored Mark doing this.
 * Generally becomes efamous at whatever she does.

### Jordan

Jordan is even deeper into roleplaying than Dakota. He plays a support role to Melissa, literally. His role is something like a royal subject. Melissa humors him because she does not have many options. He calls her "your grace", and  thinks of himself as a knight.

His attitude is disconcertingly submissive, and scornful to anyone besides Melissa, who he considers low-class.

Trivia

 * Competed with Dakota for a lead role in their WoW clan, Dakota won.
 * Addison and he play reversi when waiting for Melissa to get ready.

## Plot

The plot runs alongside the immediate entertainment. It will primarily be a struggle between the trio (indirectly led by Addison) and Melissa. This struggle takes place through various mediums, such as competitions, clan matches, and slander in the Halo 3 community.

## Visualization

All characters should have distinguishable armour, not just colors.

### Chapter One

Dakota, Addison, and Mark will encounter Melissa in a matchmaking game. She will destroy Mark, and Dakota and Addison will be impressed by her because of her fame in the forge community.

### Chapter Two

Mark will forge a shitty map, and release it under Melissa's gamertag to get back at her. Jordan (not-yet-identified) will join his game and start attacking him. Dakota and Addison try to find a way to save him; Dakota won't let Mark kick him because it would break the fourth wall.
